# vVSP-Calculator

A python script which obtains the VSP:vVSP ratio value from the Vesper app at app.vesper.finance and compares it to the spot value obtained from the balancer pool at https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xf7b90b1c3a2c31d5286b1a6472162cabf3de900c. It then returns the VSP:vVSP ratio from each application and then recommends a decision on where to exchange VSP to vVSP based on which application has a higher ratio.
